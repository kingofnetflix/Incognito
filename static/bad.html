<h1>We (or us), the party who forked (did not create) the original part of the website is not responsible for what students do on these websites.</h1>
  <p>We (or us) provide these websites out of free nature - willing for students to let their creativity roam, and unlock their full potentional of learning. Sometimes even educational websites are not working and we help fix that too.
  We are not harmful, we are co-operative. If you have any inquries, just email me at kingofnetflix@proton.me (or kingofnetflix@pm.me, no replies will be from that address).
  I would hate to take this down, so lets have a chat by email. Thank you for your time by reading this, and I hope your requests are well.</p>
